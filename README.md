# OpenTok Annotations Accelerator Pack<br/>Version 1.0

The OpenTok Annotations Accelerator Pack provides functionality you can add to your OpenTok applications that enables users to use an annotation toolbar on both mobile and browser-based devices. 

With the OpenTok Annotations Accelerator Pack, you can:

- Initiate and manage interoperable annotation features between two users, regardless of the devices they are using.
- Customize the UI features and layout.

You can create mobile apps for Android and iOS, or embed the interactive session between users into any website. 

To get started with your development, visit the following sites:

- [OpenTok Annotations Accelerator Pack for Android](./android)
- [OpenTok Annotations Accelerator Pack for iOS](./ios)
- [OpenTok Annotations Accelerator Pack for JavaScript](./js)

_**NOTE:** The app you develop requires a **Session ID**, **Token**, and **API Key**. During your development and testing you can get these values at the [OpenTok Developer Dashboard](https://dashboard.tokbox.com/). For production deployment, you must generate the **Session ID** and **Token** values using one of the [OpenTok Server SDKs](https://tokbox.com/developer/sdks/server/)._
